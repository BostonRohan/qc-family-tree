# QC Family Tree

QC Family Tree (QCFT) is a neighborhood based community organization, rooted in the Enderly Park neighborhood of West Charlotte, NC, working at the intersection of faith, culture, and social change. QCFT intentionally and actively cultivates/tends/nurtures people and places so that they might create thriving communities of abundance, justice, imagination, and mutual care for all.  Through practices of cultural organizing, we strengthen social infrastructure, expand on interdependence, mutual aid, and solidarity where it already exists.
